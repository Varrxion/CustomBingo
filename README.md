Bingo file format should be the following:

whateverfreespaceitem
whateverfirstitem
whateverseconditem
whateverthirditem


and so on. In a standard .txt file.
Each tile on a separate line of the file.

First item will always be assigned to the middle space, the rest of the list will be assigned randomly.
If there are more than 25 items, this is fine, they will be selected at random.
